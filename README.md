# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Zig
My implementation of Ray Tracing In One Weekend (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), in the Zig programming language.
Spoiler: It will take longer than one weekend.

The goal here is to learn the Zig language while following the guide.
No clue how far I'll go, however I will try to not lose interest in the project.
Happy coding.
